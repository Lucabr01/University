The topic of my final course project is a management system for a **Network-Intrusion Detection System**
built with **WebRatio**. The system uses several inline sensors to capture, analyze, and store
network traffic data in a database. The management interface is then used by various actors
to access the data and perform different tasks...See more on the [report](<ASE_Project_Report.pdf>)


#Inizializing the project

First you will have to import the [project](IntrusionDetectionSystem.zip) (if you dont know how to do it check this [video](https://my.webratio.com/learn/learningobject/organize-the-workspace-v-72?cbck=wrReq87824)
